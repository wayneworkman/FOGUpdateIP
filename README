This script is for changing the FOG Server's (Fog 1.3.0) IP address and for configuring dnsmasq automatically.
It's intended to run as a cron event every 3 minutes, should work fine on Red Hat and RH variants.
What this allows for is a 100% Mobile FOG 1.3.0 Server that uses pre-existing DHCP and will self-configure based on whatever IP the server recieves for use.

Thanks to forums.fogproject.org @sudburr for doing the initial work.
Expanded & Made better by forums.fogproject.org @Wayne-Workman
Please direct inqueries about this to the fog forums.


The main setting that will either allow or disallow changing is the /opt/fog/.fogsettings "ipaddress" setting. 
If this does not match what is actually set on the interface, then this script will update FOG's settings to use the IP address currently assigned.
The installation script does install dnsmasq too, and adds it to FOG's packages list inside .fogsettings
The script creates a root cron event that runs the main script every 3 minutes - this is what automatically keeps the IP settings updated.

This script is subject to the limitations of the attached license.txt file.
